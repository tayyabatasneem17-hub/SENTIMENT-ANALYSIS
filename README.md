Sentiment Analysis - Internship Task 4

üìå About the Project
This project is developed as part of CodTech Internship Task-4: Sentiment Analysis. The goal of the project is to analyze textual data such as tweets, reviews, or comments and determine whether the expressed sentiment is positive or negative. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is one of the most popular applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
In today‚Äôs digital era, millions of users express their opinions on social media platforms, e-commerce websites, and forums. Analyzing such text manually is impossible because of the huge volume. Sentiment analysis models automate this process, enabling businesses and organizations to quickly identify public opinion, customer satisfaction, and feedback trends.
This project demonstrates the complete process starting from data preprocessing to model building, evaluation, and visualization of insights.


üõ† Tools and Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python 3

Libraries:

pandas, numpy ‚Üí Data handling and preprocessing
matplotlib, seaborn ‚Üí Data visualization and plotting confusion matrix
scikit-learn ‚Üí ML model training and evaluation
re, string ‚Üí Text preprocessing

Algorithm Used: Multinomial Naive Bayes (commonly used for text classification)
Vectorization Technique: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
Dataset: Tweets/Reviews dataset containing text and sentiment labels (0 = Negative, 1 = Positive)
Editor/Platform: Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and Jupyter Notebook for experimentation


üîÑ Project Workflow

The project is carried out in several well-defined steps:

1. Data Collection:

A dataset of tweets/reviews with labels (positive/negative) is used.
In this project, a sample Twitter sentiment dataset is utilized.


2. Data Preprocessing:
Removal of URLs, mentions, hashtags, and punctuation.
Conversion of text to lowercase for uniformity.
Tokenization and cleaning to prepare data for model training.


3. Feature Extraction (Vectorization):
Since machine learning models cannot work directly with raw text, the data is transformed into numerical format.
TF-IDF vectorization is applied to capture the importance of words across the dataset.


4. Model Training:
A Naive Bayes classifier is trained on the processed dataset.
Naive Bayes is chosen because it is lightweight, efficient, and highly effective for text classification.


5. Evaluation:

The trained model is tested on unseen data (test set).
Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated.
A confusion matrix is visualized using a heatmap.


6. Custom Predictions:
The trained model is used to classify user-defined sentences (e.g., ‚ÄúI love this internship‚Äù ‚Üí Positive).


üåç Applications of Sentiment Analysis

Social Media Monitoring: Tracking people‚Äôs opinions on trending topics.
Customer Feedback Analysis: Understanding customer satisfaction from product reviews.
Brand Reputation Management: Companies can detect negative feedback early.
Market Research: Identifying consumer preferences and demand trends.
Political Sentiment: Measuring public reaction to policies, campaigns, or leaders.


üíª Editor and Platform Used

Visual Studio Code (VS Code): Main IDE for coding and running Python scripts.
Jupyter Notebook (optional): Used for step-by-step execution and visualization.
Python Environment: Code is executed in Python 3.x with all necessary packages installed.

‚≠ê Features of the Project

End-to-end pipeline for sentiment analysis (data cleaning ‚Üí model training ‚Üí evaluation).
Handles noisy data by removing unnecessary elements (URLs, hashtags, special symbols).
Uses TF-IDF vectorization for better feature representation.
Provides both accuracy metrics and a confusion matrix visualization.
Supports custom input testing for user-defined sentences.
Lightweight and easy to run on any system with Python installed.


‚ñ∂ How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download the repository/project files.
2. Install the required libraries using:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk
3. Place your dataset file (CSV with text and labels) in the project folder.
4. Open VS Code ‚Üí Create a Python file (e.g., sentiment_analysis.py).
5. Copy the project code into the file.
6. Run the script using:
python sentiment_analysis.py
7. The output will display:

Accuracy of the model
Classification report
Confusion matrix heatmap
Sentiment predictions for sample/custom texts


üìñ Conclusion
This project successfully implements sentiment analysis on textual data using NLP techniques. By following an end-to-end workflow, the project demonstrates how raw text can be transformed into valuable insights. Such models can be scaled and deployed in real-world applications such as customer service automation, feedback analysis, and social media monitoring.
